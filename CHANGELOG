# planned

- Add function to rename sources in existing model results
- footprint plot: allow deposition inside source area

---

# v.4.10-5
FIX: Fix missing seed info if TDonly = TRUE
FIX: Fix sensor to row mapping if TDonly=TRUE

# v.4.10-4
FIX: Fix method dispatch error (passing R objects to method calls)

# v.4.10-3
FIX: Fix parallel error occuring with R versions < 4.0

# v.4.10-2
FIX: Add temporary fix to dismiss dependencies to retired packages (rgeos and maptools)

# v.4.10-1

## performance
- Improve catalog extension algorithm

## fixed
- fix Sensors and Sources subsetting by a mixture of regex and fixed matches

---

# v.4.10-0

## performance
- changed format of TD catalogs. 
        With the new format the TD header info can be read without the need to 
        read the entire catalog into the current R session. 
        Check argument `header_only = TRUE` in `readCatalog()`.

## fixed
- memory limit for sub processes was not correctly implemented

---

# v4.9-2

## fixed
- tag_inside does less likely overwrite and not duplicate existing columns

---

# v4.9-1

## fixed:
- Fix error in slurm R script generation (argument variables was wrongly transferred)

---

# v4.9-0

## added
- add option to show progress bar (default: show) for load balanced parallel computing (C/E values)

## fixed:
- Fix average time for line sensors at plume edges
        i.e., with sub-sensors containing no touchdowns in source area
- Fix tagging touchdowns inside "sub-sources"
        tagging could fail for sources consisting of sub polygons

## performance
- deposition: Move catalog variable calculations out of loop
- deposition: Loop over catalogs & apply spatial vdep only on relevant touchdowns
- add option to switch on/off calculation of uCE, vCE, wCE output values in both main and deposition function
        default is 'CE' values only for better performance
- add gc call in .calcDep_Wrapper function to free memory

## changed
- deposition parallelism uses load balanced variant
- deposition parallelism no longer writes temporary files

## other
- add calculation time for deposition run
- be more verbose when running deposition
- state number of cores

## removed
- remove tcltk option & dependence in main function
        this caused R sessions with "bLSmodelR" attached inside a tmux session 
        when ssh X forwarding enabled to crash on detaching the session
- remove columns with intermediate input 'Calc.*' from output

---

# v4.8-0

## added:
- Subsetting Sensors and Sources by name (regular expressions possible)
        It is now possible to select e.g. all sensors starting with "M" by `my_sensors['^M']`.
- Add function to rename sensors in existing model results
- Extend footprint plot to optionally include deposition
- CHANGELOG file: Keep track of model changes

---

# v4.7-5:

## fixed:
- Fix bug affecting "tilted" line sensors where more than one catalog was calculated 
    due to the height difference.
        Before version 4.7-5 the CE values were calculated based on a single catalog only, i.e., 
        line sensors were treated as if they were "untilted", measuring on a single height.
