# planned

- Add function to rename sources in existing model results
- footprint plot: allow deposition inside source area

---

# current version:

## added:
- Subsetting Sensors and Sources by name (regular expressions possible)
        It is now possible to select e.g. all sensors starting with "M" by `my_sensors['^M']`.
- Add function to rename sensors in existing model results
- Extend footprint plot to optionally include deposition
- CHANGELOG file: Keep track of model changes

---

# v4.7-5:

## fixed:
- Fix bug affecting "tilted" line sensors where more than one catalog was calculated 
    due to the height difference.
        Before version 4.7-5 the CE values were calculated based on a single catalog only, i.e., 
        line sensors were treated as if they were "untilted", measuring on a single height.
