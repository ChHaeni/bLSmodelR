# planned

- Add function to rename sources in existing model results
- footprint plot: allow deposition inside source area

---

# current version:

## added
- add option to show progress bar (default: show) for load balanced parallel computing (C/E values)

## fixed:
- Fix average time for line sensors at plume edges
        i.e., with sub-sensors containing no touchdowns in source area

## performance
- deposition: Move catalog variable calculations out of loop

## changed
- deposition parallelism uses load balanced variant
- deposition parallelism no longer writes temporary files

## other
- add calculation time for deposition run
- be more verbose when running deposition
- state number of cores

## removed
- remove tcltk option & dependence in main function
        this caused R sessions with "bLSmodelR" attached inside a tmux session 
        when ssh X forwarding enabled to crash on detaching the session

---

# v5.8-0

## added:
- Subsetting Sensors and Sources by name (regular expressions possible)
        It is now possible to select e.g. all sensors starting with "M" by `my_sensors['^M']`.
- Add function to rename sensors in existing model results
- Extend footprint plot to optionally include deposition
- CHANGELOG file: Keep track of model changes

---

# v4.7-5:

## fixed:
- Fix bug affecting "tilted" line sensors where more than one catalog was calculated 
    due to the height difference.
        Before version 4.7-5 the CE values were calculated based on a single catalog only, i.e., 
        line sensors were treated as if they were "untilted", measuring on a single height.
